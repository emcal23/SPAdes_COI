Trying FASTQ steps!

5/13/2024

1. cd /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/saarman-group1/uphlfiles

2. mkdir fastq 

3. fastqc ./subseq/*.fq -o fastqc

*chmod -R g+w fastqc *not working? saying either I don't have permission or the directory doesn't exist
*html files are not opening as they normally have in the past - do we need to unzip and use the zipped files? -> got it! just had to download
