# SPAdes
Culex species identification and blood meal analysis with de novo assembly of illumina reads from amplicon resequencing (COI, Ace2, cqm1)

# A place to keep track of Culex blood meal bioinformatics steps

## Outline of steps:
1. seqtk to subsample reads (tens to hundreds of 1000's?)
2. fastqc to trim/clean/quality control
3. de novo assembly with SPAdes https://biomedicalhub.github.io/genomics/04-part4-denovo-assembly.html
4.
