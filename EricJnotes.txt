Using MMseqs2

## convert fasta to DB
mmseqs createdb ./input/file.fasta DB

## cluster with cluster or linclust (linclust run time scales linearly but is slightly less accurate)
mmseqs cluster DB DB_clu tmp
or
mmseqs linclust DB DB_lin_clu tmp
# ALTERNATE - minimum sequence identity for clusters can be set by adding --min-seq-id [value] as below
mmseqs linclust DB DB_lin_clu tmp --min-seq-id 0.9

## outputting files
# TSV file with representative cluster sequences on left and all members of the cluster on right
mmseqs createtsv DB DB DB_clu DB_clu.tsv
# a (pseudo?)FASTA format with the representative name of cluster and then all cluster sequences in fasta format, and the rep of next cluster etc.
mmseqs createseqfiledb DB DB_clu DB_clu_seq
mmseqs result2flat DB DB DB_clu_seq DB_clu_seq.fasta
# export only the representative sequence of each cluster
mmseqs createsubdb DB_clu DB DB_clu_rep
mmseqs convert2fasta DB_clu_rep DB_clu_rep.fasta
